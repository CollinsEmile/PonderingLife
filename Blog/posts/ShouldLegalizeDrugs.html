                    <p>
                        It&apos;s in our human nature to protect those around us.  We are social animals, and this act of protecting our 
                        tribe is an evolutionary trait that helped us survive the cruel reality that is the wild. We are soft, fragile 
                        creatures, who realised early that if we want to reach the top of the food chain, we had to stick together. In 
                        modern life this translates to us protecting ourselves from ourselves and other people, protecting your family, a mother 
                        scolding her son&apos;s bully. Yes, the consequences today are in most cases not as fatal as it once was, but it 
                        plays a major role in us being able to cope with the wilderness we find ourselves in today, modern civilization. 
                        Another example can be found in government, governments take away the freedom of people to protect them from themselves, 
                        for instance, gun laws or, and this brings me to my point, drugs.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            The first time we came together to discuss the world&apos;s drug problem, was in 1909 in Shanghai and this led to the 
                            first international drug control treaty in 1912, at the International Opium Convention of The Hague. It was around 
                            this time that China, in particular, faced an opium epidemic and these conventions had a great effect in reducing the 
                            opium problem, by reducing the production and export of opium. This was shortly followed by the American &quot;Harrison 
                            Narcotics Tax Act&quot; that further regulated the production, importation and distribution of coca and opium products. 
                        </p>

                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In 1925, the International Opium Convention was updated to include the regulation of cannabis and derivative products. 
                        Further, in 1936, we saw the first criminalization of drug trafficking on a global scale with the &quot;Convention for the 
                        Suppression of the Illicit Traffic in Dangerous Drugs&quot; treaty.
                        Then in 1961, the &quot;Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs&quot; was introduced to consolidate all the different drug treaties 
                        prior to 1961 into one treaty that allowed for new substances to be added and it forms the foundation of what we today know of 
                        as drug control. It proposed 4 schedules of drugs, a process to add new drugs that were developed, and it created the 
                        &apos;International Narcotics Control Board&apos; (INCB). It required the countries who signed the treaty (almost every country 
                        in the world today) to put measures in place to punish those who intentionally cultivate, produce, manufacture, extract, prepare, 
                        possess, offer, offer for sale, distribute, purchase, sell, deliver on any terms whatsoever, broker, dispatch, dispatch in transit, 
                        transport, import and export of drugs contrary to the provisions of this Convention. Then in 1971, the world got together for 
                        another convention, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, this placed psychoactive substances such as Psilocybin, Methamphetamine 
                        and MDMA, in their own schedules and restricted their use, with the &apos;undersigned countries&apos; required to control these 
                        substances in the same way as the Single Convention asked. These led to the criminalization of drugs in the modern world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While these treaties were done under the guise to protect the people in society from themselves, as I&apos;ve indicated in my previous 
                        article &quot;Let&apos;s think about drugs&quot;, propaganda has had a major influence in changing public opinion, which in turn 
                        changes policy. Many politicians found support in advocating for stricter laws on drug control, as the UN treaty asked for
                        punishment but not stating what type of punishment fits the crime, this was to be determined by the country itself.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What has the impact of drug control been on society?</h3>
                    <div class="col">
                            <figure>
                                <img src="/source/images/fist.jpg" class="articleImgCol3">
                            </figure>
                            <p>
                            The criminalization of drugs has had an enormous effect on people around the globe, lives have been ruined (for a non-violent crime) 
                            and lives have been lost, all in the name of drug control. All to help the people of the world. While America definitely 
                            doesn&rsquo;t have the harshest punishment for drug-related crimes, they certainly make up for it in quantity. The US has the highest 
                            number of incarcerated people in the world, 20% of which is there because of drugs. While I will say this, laws are not there to 
                            be broken and if you disobey a law, that you are aware of, regardless of whether the punishment fits the crime, you are responsible for 
                            your own actions, to a degree depending on your thoughts on free will, Sam Harris&rsquo;s book free will gives great insight into the 
                            illusion that is free will. The problem with the US comes in how they enforce and make these drug laws, political agendas are in 
                            most cases the major role, while actual statistics and science play a very minor role.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Policing also tends to lean towards biases 
                        created by the public. For instance, in the 1980s 42% of Americans thought crack cocaine &apos;was the most serious problem for 
                        American society&apos; even though there were far more alcoholics in America than crack cocaine addicts. This led to crack cocaine 
                        being punished 100 times worse than cocaine, this means if you were caught with 5 grams of crack in your possession you would face a minimum jail 
                        time of 5 years, you would need to be in possession of 500 grams of cocaine to warrant the same jail sentence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But what&rsquo;s the difference between crack cocaine and cocaine? Crack is made from using normal cocaine, mixing it with water and 
                        baking soda. It was a way of making cocaine cheap and accessible to more of the public. Now, what is the main difference 
                        between crack and cocaine apart from baking soda and water, well Wall Street bankers and Hollywood celebrities use cocaine and poor 
                        people on the street use crack, but as I said earlier public opinion is responsible for public policy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What about the rest of the world? What has the influence of drug control been?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In Mexico, the entire country&rsquo;s life expectancy went down after they decided to engage the military in their fight against 
                        drug traffickers in 2006. I obviously don&rsquo;t agree with cartels and drug smuggling mafias, but to wage war in your own 
                        country so much so that the entire country&rsquo;s life expectancy goes down seems a little counterintuitive. Many countries 
                        around the world throw people with drug abuse problems in prison, without rehabilitating them and often they still shoot/inject 
                        themselves within the prison leading to high HIV, HCV and tuberculosis transmissions among prisoners. In Vietnam, if you are 
                        caught with more than 600 grams of heroin, you will be executed. In the Philippines, you could face anything from life to the 
                        death penalty for possessing more than 10 grams of opium, morphine, heroin, cocaine, meth or 500 grams of marijuana, with minimum 
                        sentencing for less than 5 grams of a &apos;dangerous drug&apos; at 12 &ndash; 20 years jail time.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Do these extreme measures work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        In the Philippinesm apart from the human rights issue they face (look up how they police drug dealers), it seems they are losing 
                        their war on drugs as well, with an increase in amphetamine, cocaine, and cannabis usage since 2008, it is, however, hard to get 
                        clear statistics from this country. Vietnam has almost seen no change in the number of drug users since 2015 with a slight 
                        increase in methamphetamine and ecstasy use. While drug use statistics are great, I feel they don&apos;t tell the full story. 
                        As the majority of alcohol users are not alcoholics, the same holds true for drugs, the majority of drug users are not addicted. 
                        What I think is a better measure of whether a country&rsquo;s drug policies are working, is the total number of drug-related deaths 
                        and compare those trends. For example, in the last 8 years drug-related deaths have steadily increased in England, Scotland, 
                        and the USA, with opioid overdose as the main cause. These trends seem to be a good indication of drug-related deaths around 
                        the world and calls for immediate attention.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For the last 10 years, drug-related deaths have increased around the world, with most of these deaths related to opioid overdose. 
                        Just as an indication, in 2009 the US had 181.8 per million deaths related to drugs, the UK 52.8 per million and Australia 123 per 
                        million, these numbers has since increased to 314.5, 83 and 202 respectively. This shows more importantly that incarceration 
                        is not saving lives. Drugs are becoming more prevalent, and these people are not being informed in the right manner.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What other perspectives are there?</h3>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            In my article on &lsquo;let&rsquo;s think about drugs&rsquo;, I explained how Portugal in 2001 changed their perspective on drugs. 
                            Well in 2018 they reported only 6.5 people per million drug-related deaths. In 2001 Portugal had 76 drug-related deaths and in 2011 
                            ten years after their policy took effect, they had only 10 drug-related deaths in the whole country. They decriminalized the 
                            possession of drugs, making it an administrable offence, liable to a fine (if repeated offences are found) and confiscation of the 
                            drugs, no criminal charge, no stigma nor jail time. People &lsquo;caught&rsquo; with drugs are referred to Commissions, the 
                            Commission then identifies if the drug use is problematic (which it often isn&rsquo;t) and the Commission&rsquo;s purpose is to 
                            educate and help rather than judge and persecute. This led to a lot fewer people in their prisons and Portugal showing a lot 
                            fewer drug-related deaths than the European Union average. They started treating drug-dependent people instead of forgetting 
                            about them, actively helping instead of passively locking them up and throwing away the key. I think it is worth looking into 
                            this if this sounds too good to be true for you.
                        </p>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="/source/images/kindness.jpg" class="articleImgCol3">
                            <figcaption>Sometimes being kind could save a life</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        Who would think that freeing up people instead of oppressing them, helps the socioeconomic problem that is drug addiction? 
                        When we consider alcoholics, for instance, you probably don&rsquo;t know a lot of alcoholics that are alcoholics because their 
                        lives are so amazing. Other factors such as poverty, social well-being, mental health, and unemployment have far greater 
                        impacts on alcoholism than alcohol itself, alcohol is the escape from those problems, and this relates true for drugs as well. 
                        But! Decriminalization is not the reason but can rather be seen as part of the reason for the results found in Portugal. They 
                        have needle and syringe programmes, various treatment services (such as opioid substitution treatment), overdose prevention centres, 
                        education, and other harm reduction efforts, the culmination of these actions with decriminalization has led to the success we&apos;ve 
                        seen there. Portugal is not perfect, and they suffer from the same economic problems that the world face, but, it is a step in 
                        the right direction and one that it seems the United Nations, World Health Organization and other developed countries want to follow.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What about developing countries?</h4>
                    <p>
                        While decriminalization works well in the developed world, unfortunately, the developing world is plagued with corruption and a lack 
                        of planning. Colonialism can and is blamed for the state of poverty that Africa is in, but since colonialism has ended Africa 
                        has been known for dictatorship, civil war, and an obsession with the equality of outcome. The developing world is known for 
                        overcrowded and understaffed correctional facilities, with no intention of rehabilitation and disease often spreads in these prisons. 
                        While decriminalization might cause fewer people to be locked up, when you don&rsquo;t pair the decriminalization with education, 
                        treatment facilities and harm reduction planning, we are bound not to see the same extent of positive results seen in countries like 
                        Portugal, but taking the stress of their prisons will already help.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Decriminalization Vs Legalization</h3>
                    <p>
                        These are not the same, even though both are a step in the right direction, in my opinion. Decriminalization refers to making 
                        an offence not a crime, much like a traffic violation, you don&rsquo;t get a criminal record if you break the speed limit by a reasonable 
                        margin of course. Legalization could look much more like our alcohol &amp; cigarette laws; it is being sold in shops and there 
                        are no laws against adult possession. While legalization for the foreseeable future seems a little far-fetched, we may someday 
                        live in a world where we have the right support systems in place for the legalization of recreational use of drugs like psilocybin, 
                        cocaine, cannabis, and MDMA, but the proper support systems must be in place for us to safely legalize the use of these hard drugs. 
                        Hopefully, someday we won&apos;t get a criminal record for something that is not a lot different than that of alcohol, and in most 
                        cases where it isn&rsquo;t abused, is a lot less dangerous than cigarettes.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are the changes we can make in the immediate future?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 2016 March 24, issue of The Lancet, about Public Health and International Drug Policy Csete et al. recommends a few key policy 
                        changes that can be made in the immediate future, to help humanity, instead of killing off the &lsquo;addicted&rsquo;. I quote 
                        directly from the article; of the possible changes we can implement they are:
                    </p>
                    <ol class="tab">
                        <li><p>Decriminalize minor, non-violent drug offences.</p></li>

                        <li><p>Ensure easy access to harm-reduction services for all who need them as a part of responding to drugs, in doing so, recognising the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of scaling up and sustaining these services.</p></li>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>
                        Now, I don&apos;t know about you, but it seems that we've been deceived. It seems we&apos;ve been trying to be the protector of our tribe and 
                        failed. It seems what we should do, at least out of a statistical perspective, is to educate our children about safe use, your kids 
                        whether you like thinking about it or not, are more than likely going to do drugs at some point during their lives. Rather teach the 
                        people that if they do want to do drugs not to inject themselves because when you swallow a pill and you overdose, they can pump your stomach.  
                        If they are going to inject drugs, use a new clean needle because of how easily HIV, HCV, and tuberculosis spread through needles. Don&apos;t 
                        mix opioids and alcohol.  If we regulate drugs, people wouldn&apos;t be caught with &quot;spiked&quot; drugs like fentanyl, that&apos;s 50 &ndash; 100 times 
                        more potent than morphine, all the while you thought you were getting your normal opioid hit.  We must face the fact, addiction is 
                        not derived from a drug, it&apos;s a socio-economic problem.  When we start caring for people instead of throwing them in prisons, we might 
                        someday live in a better world, where people safely traverse altered states of consciousness and get that needed break from the harshness 
                        that is modern society.
