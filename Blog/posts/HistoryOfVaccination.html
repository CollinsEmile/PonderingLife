                        By now in 2022, most people are aware of vaccines, the most recent covid-19
                        pandemic has put a microscope of vaccines, and everyone has an opinion on them, but 
                        how did we stumble upon vaccinations in the first place?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Let's first set a bit of a scene for what forced us to find & develop 
                        vaccines.  Rewind 3000 years and a dead Pharoah named Ramses V is being mummified,
                        on his skin are the pustules of a disease trapped for the rest of time.  This was in 
                        fact smallpox and while most people today know of its existence, the terror it caused humanity
                        has long since been forgotten.  Smallpox is the most deadly infectious disease humanity has 
                        ever face, it killed on average 3 out of every 10 people it infected (30% mortality), though if you were 
                        1 of the 7 lucky ones to survive this disease life after smallpox was definitely not the same.  
                        The disease left scars from the pustules on the skin as a reminder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Smallpox disease has destroyed civilizations throughout history, obviously because
                        demons caused the diseases in early anitquity it is hard to know for certain apart from
                        descriptions of symptoms found or scars on the mummies in Egypt.  It is believed the Antonine Plague
                        (165 - 180 AD) in Rome was caused by Smallpox (or some have suggested Measles), needless to say,
                        it was an infectious disease that brought the greatest superpower the world has ever seen to its knees,
                        killing between 5 and 10 million people (Roughly 10% of the entirity of the Roman Empire).  In the 
                        18th Century Smallpox was the leading cause of death, every 7th child born in Russia died from Smallpox, 
                        estimated to have killed 400 000 Europeans every year in the 18th Century.  It was not only the Europeans
                        who were subject to the wrath of this disease but reports of Smallpox were found in China, 
                        Korea and Japan as early as in the 6th Century; Northern Africa, Spain and Portugal in the 7th Century;
                        European settlers brought it to the Americas in the 16th Century and again explorers brought it to Australia
                        in the 18th Century.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So why is Smallpox no longer on our minds?  Why is the greatest fear a mother had for her children in the 
                        18th Century, not even something today's mothers think of?  Well, in December 1979, the WHO (World Health Organization)
                        proclaimed that Smallpox was eradicated, meaning that there was not a single person on the Pale Blue Dot with the disease,
                        it could no longer take a loved one or leave you with scars to remember it.
                    </p>
                    <h3>How did we eradicate the Smallpox disease?</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is where our story brings us to vaccines, in 1967 the WHO launched and 'intensified' plan to eradicate
                        Smallpox through widespread immunization and surveillance and 11 years alter the last naturally occuring case 
                        was found in Somalia (1977).  This is all due to vaccines; but people weren't as to jump on the 'vax train' as you'd think,
                        people are sceptical, and vaccinations didn't develop themselves overnight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In early antiquity, people started noticing that those who got the disease and survived did not get the 
                        disease again, and then around the 10th Century in China, they noticed that those people who got the disease
                        from someone that had a late stage of the disease became less ill.  They then started experimenting with this 
                        concept and waited for people to advance into the late stage of the disease and then remove some of the puss 
                        in the pustules and dry it out in the sun, they then either blew it  into the nose of a healthy person or 
                        inserted it under the skin via a cut.  They noticed that the people would not get as sick as people who got
                        the disease the 'old-fashioned' way, but they would develop the same immunity afterwards.  So as life was back 
                        then, explorers and traders, brought this information with them on the silk road to the Middle East and Northern Africa.
                        It was here that slave traders started doing this crude way of inoculation to their slaves, this did two things for 
                        them, firstly a slave would be worth more if he/she was immune to Smallpox and secondly more slaves would survive
                        the journey to America or Europe.  One of these slaves named Onesimus got this inoculation before being sold 
                        to a church in Boston, the church then gave Onesimus to minister Cotton Mather in 1706.  In 1716 Mather wrote, "
                        Enquiring of my Negro-man Onesimus, who is a pretty intelligent Fellow, Whether he ever had the Small-Pox; he answered, 
                        both, Yes, and No; and then told me, that he had undergone an Operation, which had given him something of the Small-Pox, 
                        and would forever preserve him from it, adding that it was often used among the Guramantese, & whoever had the Courage to use it, 
                        was forever free from the Fear of the Contagion.  He described the operation to me and showed me in his Arm the Scar."
