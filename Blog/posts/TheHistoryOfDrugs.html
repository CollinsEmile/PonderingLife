                        In 1866 after experiencing a chest wound in the American Civil War, a morphine 
                        addict named John Pemberton came home, looking to cure himself of his addiction, 
                        he turned to his superpower... CHEMISTRY.  John was inspired by a certain coca wine 
                        (wine containing cocaine) from France called Vin Mariani and why wouldn't this wine 
                        inspire him, it even inspired Pope Leo XIII so much he apparently awarded the creator 
                        of Vin Mariani, Angelo Mariani, a Vatican gold medal (claimed in an advertisement by Mariani).  
                        John went into his 'lab' and mixed his coca wine because of the anaesthetic properties of cocaine, 
                        unfortunately in 1885 Atlanta & Fulton County enacted temperance legislation (they banned alcohol).  
                        This meant he had to replace the wine in the coca wine and to make a long story short, the end product 
                        still contained cocaine, they replaced the wine with carbonated water and syrup and renamed it Coca-Cola.  
                        Pemberton suffered from morphine addiction and poverty until he died in 1888.  Coca-Cola removed the coca 
                        from the cola in 1903, scared of contributing to the 'black' crime in the South.  
                        They however continued to put coca leaves in their product, just isolating the cocaine out of 
                        the leaves and giving the cocaine to the DEA.

                        It's interesting how something so despicable to many these days, resulted in one of the most popular beverages 
                        to ever grace the inside of a cup.  Drugs have a fascinating past and civilization has most certainly evolved 
                        alongside drugs, it has formed part of many cultures and was regarded as holy plants by a few.  Although many of 
                        the drugs we are familiar with today, did not exist until the 19th century, many psychoactive plants seemed to 
                        influence our culture greatly. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>How far back do these go and why did we use them?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Terrance McKenna proposed that Psilocybe Cubensis (Gold caps or "magic mushrooms") had a significant part in 
                        the evolution of the modern human (Homo Sapiens).  He suggested that Homo Erectus would follow large herds of 
                        wild cattle and eat the mushrooms that were growing on their dung.  This is however a theory proposed and one 
                        that is interesting to ponder if you've seen the much more recent study by The John Hopkins University involving 
                        Psilocybin.  They found that by combining psilocybin with therapy, they managed to significantly reduce depression, 
                        with the participants suffering from mild to severe depression before the treatment, afterwards 54% of all the 
                        participants were considered to be in remission, meaning they no longer suffered from depression.
                    </p>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            In another study 
                            back in 2016, they found that they could significantly reduce the existential anxiety experienced by people suffering 
                            from life-threatening cancer with psilocybin treatment.  They also studied the significance of psilocybin 
                            treatment in curing people of their nicotine addiction.  In 2020 they studied the long-term effect psilocybin had 
                            on negative affect associated brain function, they found that psilocybin led to changes in the neural response to 
                            affective stimuli, increased neural response to conflicting emotional information in decision-making circuits and 
                            it increases resting-state functional connectivity across brain networks.  These studies show the interesting 
                            effects psilocybin has on the brain, as these diseases are generally thought to be long-term and very hard to cure, 
                            yet acute treatment (1-3 doses) with psilocybin has had more positive and general success than most recurring treatments.  
                            It makes the theories proposed by Terrance McKenna, not such a long shot, obviously a lot more about psilocybin must be 
                            learned before we can jump to conclusions about the evolution of consciousness, but let's ponder the evolution of religion?

                        Wait, wait, wait! God doesn't agree with drug use?  As far as I'm aware the Bible says a 'hell of a lot' about burning 
                        in hell and drunkenness but not a 'hell of a lot' about getting high.  Was this because drugs like cannabis and psychedelics 
                        (such as psilocybin) was popular in the time and seen as spiritual or did they just not know of its existence?  Well, 
                        they more than likely did know of a few psychedelic substances, let's get the wording right while we're at it, and the more 
                        accurate term would be entheogen, which literally translates to "that which causes God to be within an individual".  How beautiful?  
                        So, is there evidence to suggest the use of entheogens in biblical times?  I would like to point out, that while there is 
                        evidence of the proximity of these entheogens to human societies such as the Blue Lotus Flower and ancient Egypt or the Acacia 
                        tree and most of Africa, it remains disputed whether these entheogens were consumed or whether they were just admired for 
                        their beauty.  It certainly is thought-provoking, and the significance of the Blue Lotus Flower in ancient Egypt, in my opinion, 
                        suggests something more than beauty and the shamanistic like figures such as Moses in the Bible suggests altered states of 
                        consciousness through the use of entheogens.  Winkelman compiled a list of cultural 'motifs' by surveying 47 traditional societies 
                        that recognize shamanism, these are motifs found across the globe in shamanism and there are certain consistencies around the globe.  
                        I'm not going to list all of them but instead, give you a few examples regarding Moses.

                        If you break these acts down to the bare bones, they are common among most Shamanistic tribes around the globe, it is then reasonable 
                        thought to assume that because of these similarities that other similarities such as how Moses could've entered an altered 
                        state of consciousness through an entheogen of sorts seem likely, but it is just as reasonable to assume that God altered his 
                        state of consciousness, depending on the lens you use to view the world.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Other evidence regarding the Judeo-Christian Bible that indicate the use of entheogens</h3>
                    <p>
                        When we look at the 'Temptation Fresco' found in the Chapel of Plaincourault, one can clearly see the resemblance of the 'tree of life' 
                        and the Amanita Muscaria mushroom, or can we?  In the middle of the 21st century, Robert G. Wasson studied the fresco and after two 
                        letters from art historian Erwin Panofsky, they concluded that the mushroom tree portrayed here is an impressionistic painting of an Italian 
                        pine tree (characteristic of Roman and Early Christian art).
                    </p>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            Let's for argument's sake just forget about this letter, and look at the painting through the eyes of a layman.  The first thing I 
                            noticed when looking at the painting is it's obviously the depiction of Adam and Eve, both are covering their privates, which holds 
                            very true to the text, for after they ate from this tree in the Bible, they immediately realised they were naked and covered themselves.  
                            Next and it is hard to miss, but the mushroom tree (representing the Tree of Knowledge) with the snake/serpent.  
                            In Genesis 3:4-5 the serpent speaks to Eve and says "Ye shall not surely die:  For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, 
                            then ye eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil", this passage can be interpreted to oddly coincide 
                            with what I mentioned earlier where Terrance McKenna thinks of mushrooms and the evolution of consciousness.  Back to the Fresco.  
                            It is interesting to note the ribs portrayed on Eve, in Brown & Brown (2019) they indicate that the skeleton portrayed here could 
                            be an indication of shamanism, where there is the idea that life resides in the bones, to support this claim they present this 
                            passage from an expert in shamanism, Mircea Eliade (1974), "Bones represents the very source of life, both in humans and animals.  
                            To reduce oneself to the skeleton condition is equivalent to re-entering the womb of this primordial life, that is, to a complete 
                            renewal, mystical rebirth".  
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Then there is the Mushroom Tree, the tree is bigger than Adam and Eve, which in Early Christian & Roman 
                        art was an indication of importance, or what the artist wanted to emphasize.  The other thing about the mushroom tree is the white dots 
                        on the top mushroom head, this seems to be unmistakable evidence of the resemblance between this Fresco and the Amanita Muscaria mushroom.
                        One last thing regarding this Fresco is that the biggest critic with regards to this Mushroom tree, Robert G. Wasson, at the end of his 
                        life and in his last paper, wrote the following:
                    </p>
                    <p class="quote">
                        "I once said there was no mushroom in the Bible.  I was wrong.  It plays a hidden role (this is, hidden from us until now) and a 
                        major one, in what is the best-known episode of the Old Testament, the Garden of Eden story, and what happened to Adam and Eve... 
                        I hold that the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was Soma... was Amanita Muscaria, was the Nameless Mushroom of the 
                        English-speaking people."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This truly is interesting, but it's not the only of its sort, as there is more early Christian art, portraying mushrooms and in 
                        certain paintings resembling the classic Psilocybe Cubensis more closely than that of the Amanita Muscaria.  Christianity is not 
                        the only major culture/religion to indicate the use of entheogenic substances.

                    <h3>Entheogens in other cultures</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Rigveda an ancient Indian text dating back 3000 - 4000 years is the oldest known Vedic Sanskrit text and is one of the four sacred 
                        canonical texts of Hinduism.  It consists of a collection of 10 mandalas (books) with 1028 hymns.  The whole of book 9 is dedicated to 
                        a ritual drink called Soma, drinking it is said to grant immortality and the Hindu deity Indra (the king of the heavens) is portrayed 
                        as consuming large amounts of Soma.  What the origins of Soma is, is still disputed, with only theories of what plant the juice was made 
                        of, popular theories include Psilocybe Cubensis, Amanita Muscaria, cannabis and Sarcostemma acidum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This remains unclear but an interesting parallel to Soma can be found in ancient Greece when we look at Eleusis and the mysteries that 
                        it holds.  The significance can be seen in the testimonies of famous philosophers such as Plato and Marcus Aurelius who went to Eleusis 
                        to experience the 'Mysteries' (often referred to as the Mysteries of Eleusis), Cicero even said "For among the many excellent and indeed 
                        divine institutions which your Athens has brought forth and contributed to human life, none, in my opinion, is better than those mysteries.

                            For by their means, we have been brought out of our barbarous and savage mode of life and educated and refined to a state of civilization; 
                            and as the rites are called 'initiations,' so in very truth we have learned from them the beginnings of life, and have gained the power 
                            not only to live happily, but also to die with a better hope,".  Brian Muraresku explains that people went to Eleusis to experience death, 
                            a popular idea to meditate on in stoic philosophy by the way, and then they were reborn, which seems to be a common theme among these 
                            ancient civilizations/religions.  Obviously, they didn't die but instead, they fasted and then drank this potion called Kykeon, which 
                            would give profound visions and according to Plato was blissful and divine and then they were initiated into the mysteries, "initiated 
                            into and beholding the pure sunlight the perfect, simple, calm and happy apparitions.", an ego-death occurred, and you were reborn with 
                            this new insight of the world.  
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Another parallelism to the Eleusian Mysteries can be found, in the stories of Dionysus (Greek God of Ecstacy and Wine) and his holy wine, 
                        which is said to make you divine, as Brian states so beautifully on his YouTube video regarding the Mysteries, "drinking the God to become 
                        the God" and Jesus Christ (I'm sure you're familiar) and the blood of Jesus (John: 6:52-54), which states "The Jews therefore strove among 
                        themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?  Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat 
                        the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.  Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; 
                        and I will raise him up at the last day."  Thus drinking the blood of the divine, God, to become holy yourself.  This is obviously up for 
                        interpretation, but it does have quite a few similarities to that of Dionysus, the Mysteries of Eleusis and Soma.

                        There are so many more titbits when you look at the history of humankind that can be related to the use of mind-altering substances, 
                        or it could've been God that gave them these insights and visions, we may never know but as science and the tools we use to detect 
                        substances from ancient sites and mummies are improving our understanding of the relationship our ancestors had with 'drugs' will 
                        certainly be illuminated.  What can be seen is these 'drugs' have been here with us from the beginning, we've fought wars about drugs 
                        (for example, the Opium War between China and Britain, which led to Hong Kong being a British territory for the longest time), 
                        we've at times hailed it as a miracle potion that can give us immortality (Soma), it has been thought of as holy and it has been 
                        thought of more recently as destructive and useless.  Which of these views are true, well that... only you can decide...
