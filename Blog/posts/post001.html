                <p>
                    Now I would like to get this point across, drugs are not for everyone, and I would never encourage the use of.  If abused, drugs can and will 
                    cause serious detriment to your life and in the lives of those around you.  Always exercise caution.

                    <p>I bet you look down on the so-called 'flat-earthers', and why wouldn't you?  They dispute a fact we've known since before Christ was born. 
                    Yet, you probably still believe we should drink approximately 8 glasses of water a day.  As far as I am aware this myth comes from the 
                    "Recommended Dietary Allowances" published by the National Research Council in August 1945.  Below you will read a snippet from that publication 
                    and if you read the third sentence you will see that we get most of the water we need from the food we eat.
                    </p>

                        Thus, you can see how common knowledge sometimes are shaped by falsehoods and things we perceive as true might be deceiving.  
                        Capitalism, greed, racism, 'the greater good' and 'sensationalism' are a few reasons why we should question everything we assume 
                        to be true.  Due to false information and propaganda that was spread throughout the 20th century, this idea formed that drugs are bad, 
                        that they are absolutely bad.  I thought drugs were absolutely bad, I thought nothing good could come from using 'drugs' (a loose term 
                        I use that refers to the usual suspects cocaine, cannabis, meth, heroin, etc).  One hit of heroin and you're hooked.  You could do a 
                        line of cocaine and go crazy, do things you would never do, maybe even jump out of a window on the fourth floor.  Cannabis makes you 
                        slow and leads to harder drugs.  LSD will melt your brain.  Maybe you've seen a video of a person going mad, and then you are led to 
                        believe this new drug made him that way.  What evidence is there to prove these statements?  Well, the truth is not much, there is no 
                        drug on this planet that you can get 'hooked' on from the first hit, cocaine probably won't make you think you can fly, and cannabis 
                        doesn't necessarily lead to harder drugs, but why are these misconceptions common knowledge?   
                    </p>

                            Maybe a headline from an article in the New York Times back in 1914 that states "NEGRO COCAINE 'FIENDS' ARE A NEW SOUTHERN MENACE", or an article in the Ogden Standard back 
                            in 1915, that reads with a headline "Is the Mexican Nation 'Locoed' by a Peculiar Weed" or maybe "Reefer Madness" rings a bell.  
                            If you don't know what "Reefer Madness" is, it is a propaganda film about drugs back in 1936 with great quotes such as "The burning weed 
                            with its roots in Hell", the film portrays high school students that go insane due to their cannabis addiction.  While these don't seem 
                            extremely relevant to you today, those statements shaped the minds of your grandparents, in a time when you couldn't just quickly 
                            double-check a fact, this led to the criminalization of drugs and led to the thought that drugs are the reason for the crime on our 
                            streets or neighbourhoods.  
                        </p>

                        They then instilled those values in your parents and guess what happened in 1970, 
                        the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was passed, creating the 5 schedules Americans know today.  Placing the drugs we know under 
                        Schedule 1 controlled substances.  The criteria for a drug to be placed in Schedule 1 is the following:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dd><p class="tab">1.  The drug or other substance has a high potential for abuse</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">2.	The drug or other substance has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the US</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">3.	There is a lack of accepted safety for use of the drug or other substance under medical supervision</p></dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>
                        No prescriptions may be be written for Schedule 1 substances, and such substances are subject to production quotas which the DEA imposes.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then in 1971, President Nixon declared his 'war on drugs', a year later though the National Commission on Marihuana and drugs presented 
                        their findings regarding cannabis in a report called:  "Marihuana, A signal of misunderstanding", they noted that cannabis users are 
                        not dangerous at all, they are actually "timid, drowsy and passive", they then concluded to suggest other methods than criminalization 
                        to discourage its use.  Nixon didn't care for these findings of the commission that he authorized, which seems typical of how we react 
                        to drugs today and the rest as they say, is history.  Drugs kept getting a bad rap, drug users were throwing away their lives and crime 
                        was due to addicts looking for their next hit.
                    </p>

                        <p> 
                            But are drugs the main cause of crime on our streets?  In studies by Dr Carl Hart they found that when a drug user from the street is 
                            presented with a choice between a line of cocaine or a 5$ bill, the addict will take the 5$ bill about 50% of the time.  This was the 
                            same regarding Meth or Heroin.  What is interesting is that when instead of a 5$ bill they gave out a 20$ bill, the participants rarely 
                            took the drug.  This was crazy when I first found out about this study, because it goes against the 'I will do anything to get a hit' 
                            narrative that I've grown up with.  Further, above 70% of people who use drugs are not addicted to them, I thought 100% of heroin users
                            are addicted to it, again it seems I am lacking the knowledge required to make a judgement call on these drugs.

                    <p>
                        Seeing that most of Western Society is built on Christianity, what is the perspective from a Christian view?  In researching this article 
                        when I came across a Christian article about drugs, and on the question 'What the Bible says about drugs?' they state the following: "Drugs
                        were virtually non-existent during biblical times.  Thus, substances such as LSD, marijuana, heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, methamphetamine, and 
                        any number of others aren't mentioned in Scripture.  However, God makes it clear that he prohibits drunkenness (see Proverbs 23:20-21, 29-35)."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ok, let's just digest this statement.  Yes, the first LSD trip wasn't had by a disciple of Jesus but rather a Swiss chemist named Dr Albert 
                        Hofmann, and on the 19th of April, we now celebrate Bicycle Day, in honour of the first bicycle 'trip' on LSD.  Heroin was first put in 
                        production in 1898 by the Bayer Company in Germany.  Ecstasy (MDMA) was first developed in 1912, also by a German Pharmaceutical Company 
                        called Merck.  Methamphetamines were first synthesized by a Japanese chemist in 1893.  Cocaine was first isolated in 1860, by a German chemist
                        Albert Niemann.  Marijuana (Cannabis) on the other hand was there long before Moses crossed the Red Sea.  The earliest signs of cannabis use 
                        are found approximately 8000bc in Taiwan, where twisted strands of hemp were used for making patterns on clay pottery.   While people theorize 
                        the use of Psilocybe Cubensis (magic mushrooms) and the Blue Lotus Flower in ancient Egypt, the Greeks talk about a substance called Kykeon
                        which led to 'profound' visions.  Psychoactive drugs definitely existed in biblical times, and many theorise that many religions were born 
                        out of the visions and experiences of these psychoactive plants.  Fun fact in Africa where Moses saw a burning bush, it could've been an
                        acacia tree, which includes dimethyltryptamine or DMT for short.  There are strong reasons to believe that mind-altering plants were a big 
                        part of Christianity, when we take a closer look at early Christian art, yet today, it is frowned upon.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            But even if what we perceive is a misconception, drugs don't have any good qualities, do they?  Well at the John Hopkins University in the US, 
                            close to 75% of the participants involved in their studies on psychedelics, will rank it as one of the most meaningful experiences of their 
                            lives.  They also found great success regarding depression and anxiety, with only 1-3 high doses of psilocybin.  It truly is an amazing 
                            statistic, as I can't think of many things 75% of us agree on, not even considering the significance of one of the most meaningful moments 
                            of your life.  That means that these participants ranked their psilocybin trip up there with the birth of their child or with their wedding day.
                            Hopefully, with a more open view of the world and some thought, we may in the future be able to leverage some of these substances in a good, 
                            healthy, and safe way to overcome the challenges we face today.

                        Inevitably, when you are as curious a person as I am, you will come across certain things and experiment.  I, myself encountered a few drugs 
                        on my journey through life.  The first drug was cannabis, and it was a great high, but even though I was told how bad this was, I didn't have 
                        any negative long-term effects from that use, and I've since grown to enjoy my occasional cannabis.  The next drug I did, was cocaine.  Yes, 
                        I followed in the footsteps of Sherlock Holmes, Sigmund Freud, Stephen King and apparently even Obama, and snorted the white stuff.  I was 
                        amazingly surprised that I didn't lose my mind, yes, I talked a bit faster and falling asleep was hard, but I had full cognitive control, I 
                        would say alcohol made me more of a 'fiend' than cocaine ever did.  This made me realise that maybe what I've believed so concretely, might 
                        not be true.  Then about a year ago, I travelled to Psilocybe Cubensis, fully expecting that I might go crazy but recent studies have shown 
                        positive effects and friends advocating for how amazing it was, convinced me to try it.  I didn't go crazy.  As the 3 grams of psilocybin
                        mushrooms were making its way through my system, I experienced two extremely profound moments, one moment where I experienced the deepest 
                        and saddest feeling I've ever felt and one moment where I felt true unadulterated happiness, it was bliss, like a cool breeze on a summers 
                        day, like the heat of the sun on your skin, absent of all heartache or sadness.  These were the types of experiences I would describe as 
                        religious and it was after this experience that I knew, I had to break this perception I had of what drugs are.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first thing I did was I had to admit my ignorance.  I had to acknowledge that maybe common knowledge wasn't all as knowledgeable as I 
                        thought and in research, for this article I realised that a lot of how drugs are perceived is because of political, social, and racial agendas.
                        The world is full of horror stories of drug addicts, but that doesn't innately make it bad.  Many things in this world can cause significant 
                        trauma to us and the people close to us, but we live with it all around us.  Joe Rogan said on his podcast that it amazes him that he can drive
                        to a liquor store at this very moment and buy enough alcohol to kill himself, but he will be locked up in certain states if he lights a joint  
                        (cannabis cigarette).  Does that mean alcohol is absolutely bad and we should not use it?  I'll leave that up to you.  Here are some statistics 
                        found on addictioncenter.com for the USA:
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 1.4 million people in the United States are regular hallucinogen users</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 6% of American adults (about 15 million people) have an alcohol use disorder</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- 2 million Americans misused prescription opioids for the first time in 2017</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 494,000 Americans over the age of 12 are regular heroin users</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 34 million Americans smoke cigarettes</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 5 million Americans are regular cocaine users</p></dd>
                        <dd><p class="tab">- About 774,000 Americans are regular meth users</p></dd>
                    </dl>
                    <p>
                        Ok wait, here you can clearly see the problem is cigarettes and alcohol.  All the other drug users combined only make up a third of the
                        alcoholics in America.  No one can put an amount on a person's life, and if you can help it, one life is as important as twenty, 
                        just because more people died because of cigarette addiction than of heroin overdose doesn't mean we shouldn't care about the people 
                        dying from heroin overdoses, but criminalizing them for their dependence on a drug and shunning them out of society is not going to save 
                        lives.  We must change our attitude towards drugs and start helping.
                    </p>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            In 2001, Portugal decided as a country to change their attitude towards drugs, they decriminalized all drugs for personal possession, 
                            making it an administrative offence, which means no jail time and no record, you are subject to a fine and confiscation of drugs if you are caught.  
                            This changed the way drugs were perceived in Portugal, people were being helped instead of thrown in jail and the numbers show it.  
                            In 2015 overdoses were responsible for only 6 deaths per million people in Portugal, whereas the EU average is hovering at 23.7 deaths 
                            per million people.

                        These are staggering result and in 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) made a YouTube video that I would suggest watching, you can 
                        find the link in the references, but the closing words stuck with me and encapsulates caring for people suffering from addiction.  "Drug 
                        dependence is not a choice, it never has been, it's a complex mental health condition and not a 'self-acquired bad habit'.
                    </p>

                            It can be prevented to improve wellbeing.  Today we invest, tomorrow we move forward."  This humanitarian view seems to be working in Portugal, 
                            whereas the United States of America seems to be losing the 'war on drugs'.  Let's open our eyes to the truth and challenge common knowledge, 
                            this article tries to give you a glimpse into the vast amount of knowledge and research that is being done regarding addiction and drug 
                            dependence.  Go out and do your own research, explore, and ingest as much information as you can find.  There are safer ways to do drugs, 
                            and there are practices to know when something is getting out of hand, by educating ourselves and those around us, we may be able to make 
                            a difference and save a life.
